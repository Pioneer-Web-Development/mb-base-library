DEPRECATED | MB Base Library 
============================

*This library was for use with Zen templates and will not work with Flex without serious updating.*

Becker's custom utility components for Blox. Many of these are required if you're going to be installing my custom MBDEV blocks to your templates. 

I'll add the version of the components file to the suffix of the .zip files. All you'll need to do is use the Blox importer in the components portion of the Template Editor to bring them into your site.
